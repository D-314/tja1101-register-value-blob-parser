 Register name: [ Symbol error counter register] register addr: [20] register value: [0x0000] or [0b_0000_0000_0000_0000]
 The symbol error counter is incremented when an invalid code symbol is received (including idle symbols). The counter is incremented only once per packet, even when the received packet contains more than one symbol error. This counter increments up to 216. When the counter overflows, the value FFFFh is retained. The counter is reset when the register is read.
